# Zero-Waste
Zero-Waste is a web-based waste buying and selling platform for sellers to sell their recyclable and non-recyclable waste, and buyers to find waste items to buy. So, sellers can publish advertisements about their waste with their location and buyers can give offers to the advertisements. Then sellers can see the buyers’ ratings and information before accepting or rejecting the offer from buyers. Also, buyers can sell their bulk waste to recycling companies. When a company posts an advertisement asking for a waste item, the buyer can give offers to the company saying price and quantity. If the company accepts the offer, then the buyer can sell the bulk waste to the company. This system will act as a middle party between buyers, sellers and recycling companies that connect them together.

Users of the system:
• Seller (A person who has collected waste in their houses, shops etc.)
• Buyer (A person or a group of people who buy waste)
• Company (A recycling company or organization that uses a large amount of recyclable items)
• Admin
